howdy howdy new roboticeers this is definitely the first repository named this


Alright, so you want to code?


Basically until I can figure out how to get of my 3-5 class at college this is the best I can do, but hopefully it will at least give an idea
about what coding is all about. 

I may or may not have forgotten how to use github so i may or may not be doing this in the worst way possible but its okay so lets go

When you start any sort of robot code, you need a HARDWARE MAP. This is basically code to set up the TeleOP, or driver controlled portion of competition.
I'm sure Mr. Barrett has explained how games work (hopefully) so I'm not going to get into that here, but just know TeleOP is driver controlled and
Autonomous is well, autonomous (most of the coding pain comes from this section but its also really fun so its okay).

Anyway, the hardware map essentially defines each motor/servo and then defines what moves how when someone hits a button on the gamepad. Traditionally, games are
played with 2 drivers, but our team usually just has 1 because 1) its much easier (at least for the games we had) and 2) our team was super small. How you want to
drive will be up to you guys later, but for now go into RedLionRoboticsClub/UltimateGoal/2021BasicHardwareMap, where you will see I have (at some point) commented in how stuff works. (if u r reading this not yet cuz i ran out of time im busy sorry)



A just in case TLDR in case i dont have time before club today

In UltimateGoal, look at
-BasicHardwareMap (hw map)
-BasicerAuto (simple auto code i think? i dont remember but i have class in now)
-Colinwillbemad (teleop i think)
