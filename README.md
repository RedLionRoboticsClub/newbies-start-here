howdy howdy new roboticeers this is definitely the first repository named this


Alright, so you want to code? Epiccccc!


Basically until I can figure out how to get of my 3-5 class at college this is the best I can do, but hopefully it will at least give an idea
about what coding is all about. 

I may or may not have forgotten how to use github so i may or may not be doing this in the worst way possible but its okay so lets go

When you start any sort of robot code, you need a HARDWARE MAP. This is basically code to set up the TeleOP, or driver controlled portion of competition.
I'm sure Mr. Barrett has explained how games work (hopefully) so I'm not going to get into that here, but just know TeleOP is driver controlled and
Autonomous is well, autonomous (most of the coding pain comes from this section but its also really fun so its okay).

Anyway, the hardware map essentially defines each motor/servo and sets parameters. Now go into RedLionRoboticsClub/UltimateGoal/2021BasicHardwareMap, where you will see I have commented in how stuff works.

Looked through that? Understand everything? Great! Understand nothing? Completely what I expected! I have been called incompetent at teaching but its okay, this is a learning experience for everyone!

Next important file is ColinWillBeMad. This is the teleop file which uses what is defined in the hardware map to link to the gamepad/gamepads that will be used for the driver controlled segment. Traditionally, games are played with 2 drivers, but our team usually just has 1 because 1) its much easier (at least for the games we had) and 2) our team was super small. How you want to drive will be up to you guys later, but for now just look through the file and attempt to comprehend it.

Final thing for right now until i figure out what im doing better is check out the BasicerAuto and BasicAuto files. These will be the important things you will need to probably learn how to do good, but dont worry im basically a professional and I will help you achieve the great things. The professional part is a lie but trust me I know whats up for the most part. 

Anyway, if you have questions you can either bother Mr. Barrett to email them to me or just email them to me yourself at rynkmr3@gmail.com because that is much less annoying for everyone involved probably. 



TLDR in case you are like me and cant read more than 5 words at a time

In UltimateGoal, look at:

-BasicHardwareMap (hw map)

-Colinwillbemad (teleop)

-BasicerAuto/BasicAuto (autonomous code)


I have commented in explanations on how stuff works to the best of my very limited teaching ability.
